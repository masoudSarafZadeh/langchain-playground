# Hierarchical Deep Agent with Task Tracking

This sub-repository contains a fully modular, hierarchical multi-agent system built using modern LangChain and LangGraph. 

Unlike standard, flat ReAct agents that struggle with context pollution during long-running tasks, this project implements a **Deep Agent Architecture**. It uses a central supervisor agent to coordinate workflows, track progress via a built-in TODO list, and isolate heavy research tasks out to specialized sub-agents.

## Project Architecture

The agent's brain is broken down into a clean, separated module system:

* **`main.py`**: The entry point that orchestrates the initialization, builds the graph execution flows, and handles user queries.
* **`src/state.py`**: The single source of truth (`DeepAgentState`) managing conversational history, local virtual file frames, and the live task tracker.
* **`src/todo_tools.py` & `src/file_tools.py`**: The manager's tools for modifying project checklists and reading/writing files.
* **`src/research_tools.py`**: High-efficiency lookup capabilities (such as Tavily search) isolated specifically for research nodes.
* **`src/task_tool.py`**: The delegation bridge allowing the manager to spin up independent sub-agents dynamically.

## Quick Start & Setup

Follow these steps to run this cookbook sample locally:

### 1. Navigate to the Sub-Repository
```bash
cd full_agent
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (venv).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Setup Your Environment Variables
Copy the configuration template to create a live .env file:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```
Open the newly created .env file and insert your respective API credentials:

```plaintext
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_claude_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_actual_tavily_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
```
### 4. Run the Agent
Execute the runtime orchestrator:

```bash
python main.py
```
## Key Design Features
* **State-Saving Components:** Uses Command(update={...}) states to keep the agent's actions completely trackable.

* **Context Isolation:** Sub-agents are systematically provisioned with a fresh memory frame containing only the text relevant to their individual task, protecting the manager from token bloat.

* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Sub-agents are restricted to safe toolsets, ensuring they can perform research without accidentally altering master file paths or mutating the supervisor's agenda.
